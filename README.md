# Clojure Bioinformatics Format Parsers

Welcome to the **Clojure Bioinformatics Format Parsers** organization!

## About

This organization serves to bundle development on Clojure libraries that implement parsers, readers, and writers for data formats commonly used in Bioinformatics.

## Goals

### Current Focus

- Develop high-quality, idiomatic Clojure libraries for parsing bioinformatics file formats
- Provide readers and writers for common bioinformatics data formats
- Ensure libraries are well-documented, tested, and maintained

### Future Vision

The long-term aim of this organization is to move towards creating and curating formal descriptions for all supported formats in machine-readable formats, including:

- **BNF Grammars** - Formal grammar specifications
- **XSDs** - XML Schema Definitions for XML-based formats
- **JSON Schemas** - Schema definitions for JSON-based formats

These formal specifications will enable better tooling, validation, and interoperability across the bioinformatics ecosystem.
