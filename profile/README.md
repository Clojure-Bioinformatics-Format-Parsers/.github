# Clojure Bioinformatics Format Parsers

Welcome to the **Clojure Bioinformatics Format Parsers** organization!

**Currently, all code under this Org is vibe-coded slop.** This includes this Readme, except this note. But I am somewhat serious about the underlying idea.

## About

This organization serves to bundle development on Clojure libraries that implement parsers, readers, and writers for data formats commonly used in Bioinformatics.

## Goals

### Current Focus

- Develop idiomatic Clojure libraries for parsing bioinformatics file formats
- Provide readers and writers for common bioinformatics data formats
- Ensure libraries are well-documented, tested, and maintained

### Future Vision

A long-term vision for this project is to move towards creating and curating formal descriptions for all supported formats in machine-readable formats, including:

- **BNF Grammars**
- **XSDs**
- **JSON Schemas**
- **Kaitai Structs**
